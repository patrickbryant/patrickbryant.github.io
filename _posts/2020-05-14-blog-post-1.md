Two of my absolute favorite public intellectual figures, [Ezra Klein](https://www.vox.com/authors/ezra-klein) (journalist and founder of Vox Media) and [Sean Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com),
(physicist and science communicator) recently got together to talk about physics.
The resulting [podcast](https://megaphone.link/VMP8224086718) is the best conversation I've heard between a non-physicist and physicist about quantum mechanics.
They have inspired me to write up a few of the ways I have come to terms with physics.
What follows are my expansions on their discussion, have included time stamps so that you can follow along. 

**16:20** Quantum Beings having a Classical Experience


**18:00** The distinction between Many Worlds and Copenhagen. It's philosophy and that's OK!


**20:30** "The universe is branching an uncountable number of times every second"


**24:40** -27:50 On the Dimensionality of Hilbert Space
Infinite dimensional - the differences between countable and uncountable QIP$^*$=RE


**28:00** On "violating" the laws of thermodynamics
Energy conservation - Partition functions - microstates and macrostates


**32:00** On the _Reality_ of the Wave Function
Determinism vs Chaos: Initial conditions are hidden variables (37:50 after the ad break)
Intuitionist Mathematics
The rules of dynamics can be written down but their exact consequences cannot.


**40:40** On the implications of Everrettian Interpretation. The range of possible 'worlds'. Is it possible to make Ezra into a classical violinist instantly without violating physical laws?
The remarkable robustness of _classical_ computers. 


**55:00** On adding a 'camera' to a double slit experiment
What does the camera do that the atoms in the slit do not? Answer, the state of the atoms in the slit are not sensitive to a passing particle.


**59:50** Defining Entaglement: Nuclear decay, momentum conservation:
Someone observes decay product in a place far away - instantly know which way the other particle went and where it is now.
(What is meant by 'World' in the Many Worlds interpretation?)
 Meanwhile, someone on the other side far away observes a decay product, no causal connection between the observers, almost certainly observed the particles in locations inconsistent with conservation of momentum - implies their states are almost perfectly decoupled from eachother, being able to interact would appear to violate momentum conservation.


**1:15:57** On the Solidness of Things: How QM is a critical part of allowing our classical experience
Why Ideal Gases are a thing
Spin-statistics


**1:18:40** Good New Bad News: The future of physics in a world that we mostly understand despite seemingly inconsistent physics in extreme circumstances.
