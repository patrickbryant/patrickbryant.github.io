Two of my absolute favorite public intellectual figures, [Ezra Klein](https://www.vox.com/authors/ezra-klein) (journalist and founder of Vox Media) and [Sean Carroll](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com),
(physicist and science communicator) recently got together to talk about physics.
The resulting [podcast](https://megaphone.link/VMP8224086718) is the best conversation I've heard between a non-physicist and physicist about quantum mechanics.
They have inspired me to write up a few of the ways I have come to terms with physics.
What follows are my expansions on their discussion. I've tried to make it useful as a standalone bit of writing but have also included time stamps so that you can follow along with the podcast. 


**16:20** Quantum Beings having a Classical Experience  
The phrase "We are not classical beings having a quantum experience, we're quantum beings having a classical experience" gets to the heart of why the subject of quantum mechanics is so hard.
There is no way for the [messy bags of meat that are human beings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They're_Made_Out_of_Meat) to have a quantum experience of the world.
We don't need quantum mechanics to understand the principle that makes such experience impossible.
If I told you that a peacfully floating helium party balloon contains $10^23$ atoms zooming and bouncing around at 2800mph in just such a way that their motions all perfectly cancel such that rubber walls don't even perceptibly jiggle,
and you hadn't had this explained before, you likely wouldn't believe me. 


**18:00** It's philosophy and that's OK!
At this point in the discussion, Ezra notes that in trading the Copenhagen interpretation for Many Worlds, we trade the uncomfortable notion that measurment somehow changes reality for the equally uncomfortable notion that
reality continues smoothly but along an exponentially growing set of decoupled branches.
Both of these interpretations are bizzare and uncomfortable, but remarkably, they are operationally identical! There is no experiment, even in principle that would allow use to tell us which interpretation is "correct".
The reason for this is that the Copenhagen rules for measurment are logically [redundant](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11060) if you assume that any finite quantum system can be described with finitely many parameters,
and that the outcome of a measurment cannot depend on the arbitrary definitions of boundaries between subsystems.

The value of thinking about these different interpretations is the same as the value of understanding anything in multiple ways. Different perspectives inspire new ideas which may or may not be useful.
Sean is interested in Many Worlds because he believes it could be a useful stepping stone to understanding how the structure of spacetime emerges from a more abstract quantum mechanical system.


**20:30** Some infinities are bigger than others
Grappling with the enormity of the thing implied by the Many Worlds interpretation, Ezra quips that "the universe is branching an uncountable number of times every second...".
Most people use the word "uncountable" to mean "so many I can't imagine counting" but mathematicians use it to mean "so many it is not possible in principle to count".
This is a pedantic point that recently has turned out to have quite dramatic consequences for the field of computer science known as Complexity Theory. More on that in the next section.
No one can count the entire set of natural numbers 1,2,3,... but it is easy to imagine how you would count them, it would just take literally forever.
It's a bit harder to imagine counting the set of positive rational numbers but with a bit of thought it might occur to take
$$ \frac{n}{n}, \frac{n]{n-1}, \frac{n}{n-2}, ..., \frac{n}{1} $$
starting with n=1 and increasing n by one each time the sequence terminates giving:  
$$ \frac{1}{1}, \frac{2}{2}, \frac{2}{1}, \frac{3}{3}, \frac{3}{2}, \frac{3}{1}, \frac{4}{1},... $$
This defines a process by which one could, given infinite time, count all of the positive rational numbers.
It's not hard to generalize this to the set of all rational numbers which would be a proof that the rational numbers are "countably infinite"


**24:40** -27:50 On the Dimensionality of Hilbert Space  
Infinite dimensional - the differences between countable and uncountable QIP$^*$=RE


**28:00** On "violating" the laws of thermodynamics  
Energy conservation - Partition functions - microstates and macrostates


**32:00** On the _Reality_ of the Wave Function  
Determinism vs Chaos: Initial conditions are hidden variables (37:50 after the ad break)
Intuitionist Mathematics
The rules of dynamics can be written down but their exact consequences cannot.


**40:40** On the implications of Everrettian Interpretation.  
The range of possible 'worlds'. Is it possible to make Ezra into a classical violinist instantly without violating physical laws?
The remarkable robustness of _classical_ computers. 


**55:00** On adding a 'camera' to a double slit experiment  
What does the camera do that the atoms in the slit do not? Answer, the state of the atoms in the slit are not sensitive to a passing particle.


**59:50** Defining Entaglement: Nuclear decay, momentum conservation:  
Someone observes decay product in a place far away - instantly know which way the other particle went and where it is now.
(What is meant by 'World' in the Many Worlds interpretation?)
 Meanwhile, someone on the other side far away observes a decay product, no causal connection between the observers, almost certainly observed the particles in locations inconsistent with conservation of momentum - implies their states are almost perfectly decoupled from eachother, being able to interact would appear to violate momentum conservation.


**1:15:57** On the Solidness of Things: How QM is a critical part of allowing our classical experience  
Why Ideal Gases are a thing
Spin-statistics


**1:18:40** Good New Bad News  
The future of physics in a world that we mostly understand despite seemingly inconsistent physics in extreme circumstances.
