Climate change is the most serious existential threat facing humanity. Over the next few decades more frequent extreme weather events and
increasing probability of zoogenic pandemics threaten to destabilize economies and governments around the world.
Even the Pentagon recognizes the national security implications of climate change calling it a [*threat multiplier*](https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/603440/hagel-to-address-threat-multiplier-of-climate-change/).
If your goal is to have fewer violent extremists and rogue nations,
it is also your goal to avoid needlessly generating hundreds of millions of climate refugees
desperately trying to find higher ground, housing and economic opportunity among politically fragile, economically stressed countries --
not to mention all the [strategically valuable bases threatened by rising sea levels and violent storms](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5689153/DoD-Final-Climate-Report.pdf).

**Work in Progress**


The Scale of The Problem
------
The amount of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere is set in a dynamic process of plants, ocean life and other chemical reactions constantly pumping out and absorbing hundreds of billions of tons of carbon per year.
Humans are currently responsible for emitting around ten billion tons of carbon per year.
Compared to the ongoing natural carbon cycle this sounds like a small effect. It is not.

The natural exchanges of hundreds of billions of tons of carbon per year reached today's values after fine tuning adjustments which take tens of thousands of years.
On this time scale the percent level addition of human activity to the carbon cycle is an unprecedented discontinuous jump. The end of the ice age (10-20 thousand years ago) is a tiny blip compared to what we are doing.

Mitigating the threat multiplier of climate change requires dropping the net carbon emissions of humanity to zero over the next decade.
We have already failed to do this and are accepting ever growing risk as we drag our collective feet into the future.

The ten or so trillion kilograms of CO$_2$ produced annually by humanity corresponds to about ten trillion watts of power consumption.
We will need to install tens of trillions of watts of carbon neutral power generation and distribution over the next few decades
to update the current dirty electrical grid and electrify transportation and industrial processes which consume fossil fuels.

Humanity is thus presented with the single largest investment and wealth generation opportunity in history.
Picture a new industrial revolution driven by zero marginal cost renewable energy with
[fixed costs less than the continued operation of existing fossil fuel plants](https://rameznaam.com/2020/05/14/solars-future-is-insanely-cheap-2020/).
Noah Smith, an economist and writer for Bloomberg and himself on [substack](noahpinion.substack.com),
has a great explanation of why this will soon come about [here](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/answering-the-techno-pessimists-part-a3b).

The primary reasons for hope are plots like this:

  <figcaption style="text-align:left">Over the last decade the price of utility scale solar power has dropped by 30-40% every time the installed capacity doubles.

</figure>
Our future can be bright due to an effect known as [Wright's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects) which states that for most technologies,
the cost per unit falls by a fixed percentage every time cumulative production increases by a fixed factor (typically measured as a percent per doubling).
One of the primary functions of government is to subsidize the development and production of technologies until their unit prices are sufficiently low for market forces to take over.


The Energy "Market"
------
The energy market is not a normal market. Depending on where you live, you likely have no choice in where to send your money in exchange for electricity.

**Work in Progress: This is where I will explain how utilities make money and why cap and trade makes less sense than renewable portfolio standards**
