Climate change is the most serious existential threat facing humanity. Over the next few decades more frequent extreme weather events and
increasing probability of zoogenic pandemics threaten to destabilize economies and governments around the world.
Even the Pentagon recognizes the national security implications of climate change calling it a ["threat multiplier"](https://www.defense.gov/Explore/News/Article/Article/603440/hagel-to-address-threat-multiplier-of-climate-change/).
If your goal is to have fewer violent extremists and rogue nations,
it is also your goal to avoid needlessly generating hundreds of millions of climate refugees
desparately trying to find higher ground, housing and economic opportunity among politically fragile, economically stressed countries --
not to mention all the [strategically valuable bases threatened by rising sea levels and violent storms](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5689153/DoD-Final-Climate-Report.pdf).

The Scale of The Problem
------
The amount of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere is set in a dynamic process of plants, ocean life and other chemical reactions constantly pumping out and absorbing hundreds of billions of tons of carbon per year.
Humans are currently responsible for emitting on the order of ten billion tons of carbon per year.
Compared to the ongoing natural carbon cycle this sounds like a small effect. It is not.

These natural exchanges of hundreds of billions of tons of carbon per year reached their current values after fine tuned adjustments which take tens of thousands of years.
On this time scale the percent level addition of human activity to the carbon cycle is an enormous and unprecidencted discontinous jump. The end of the iceage is a tiny blip commpared to what we are doing.
