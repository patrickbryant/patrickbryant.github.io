This letter presents a combination of searches for Higgs boson pair production using up to 36.1\\( \text{fb}^{−1} \\) of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy \\( \sqrt{\text{s}} \\)=13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The combination is performed using six analyses searching for Higgs boson pairs decaying into the \\( \text{b}\bar{\text{b}} \text{b}\bar{\text{b}} \\), \\( \text{b}\bar{\text{b}} \text{WW} \\), \\( \text{b}\bar{\text{b}} \tau\tau \\), \\( \text{WWWW} \\), \\( \text{b}\bar{\text{b}}\gamma\gamma \\) and \\( \text{WW} \gamma\gamma \\) final states. Results are presented for non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production modes. The combined observed limit at 95% confidence level on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section is 6.9 times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. Limits are also set on the ratio (\\( \kappa_{\lambda} \\)) of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its Standard Model value. This ratio is constrained at 95% confidence level to −5.0<\\( \kappa_{\lambda} \\)<12.0. In addition, limits are set on the production of narrow scalar resonances and spin-2 Kaluza-Klein Randall-Sundrum gravitons. Exclusion regions are also provided in the parameter space of the habemus Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and the Electroweak Singlet Model.
