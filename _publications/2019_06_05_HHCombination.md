This letter presents a combination of searches for Higgs boson pair production using up to 36.1 fb\\( ^{−1} \\) of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy √s=13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The combination is performed using six analyses searching for Higgs boson pairs decaying into the bbbb, bbWW, bbττ, WWWW, bbγγ and WWγγ final states. Results are presented for non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production modes. The combined observed limit at 95% confidence level on the non-resonant Higgs boson pair production cross-section is 6.9 times the predicted Standard Model cross-section. Limits are also set on the ratio (κλ) of the Higgs boson self-coupling to its Standard Model value. This ratio is constrained at 95% confidence level to −5.0<κλ<12.0. In addition, limits are set on the production of narrow scalar resonances and spin-2 Kaluza-Klein Randall-Sundrum gravitons. Exclusion regions are also provided in the parameter space of the habemus Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and the Electroweak Singlet Model.
