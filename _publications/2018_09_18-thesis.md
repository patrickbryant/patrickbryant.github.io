A search for Higgs boson pair production in the bbbb final state is carried out with up to 36.1 fb\\( ^{-1} \\) of LHC protonâ€“proton collision data collected at \\( \sqrt{\text{s}} \\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016. Three benchmark signals are studied: a spin-2 graviton decaying into a Higgs boson pair, a scalar resonance decaying into a Higgs boson pair, and Standard Model non-resonant Higgs boson pair production. This thesis presents a search in events with four individually resolved b-tagged jets. Higgs bosons produced with large momenta are reconstructed as single large radius jets with substructure. The analysis of this topology is presented in [[197]](https://cds.cern.ch/record/2634867). The two analyses are statistically combined and upper limits on the production cross section of Higgs boson pairs times branching ratio to \\( \text{b}\bar{\text{b}} \text{b}\bar{\text{b}} \\) are set in each model. The combined result searches for resonance masses in the range 260-3000 GeV. No significant excess is observed; the largest deviation of data over prediction is found at a mass of 280 GeV, corresponding to 2.3 standard deviations globally. The observed 95% confidence level upper limit on the non-resonant production is 13 times the Standard Model prediction.
