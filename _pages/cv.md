Post-Graduate Research
======

High Granularity Calorimeter (HGCal) Module Assembly Center (MAC)
------

HGCal is an upgrade to the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment endcap calorimeters. 

Graduate Research
======

Developement and Integration of the Fast TracKer (FTK):
------

FTK is a highly parallelized system of custom hardware and firmware to reconstruct the tracks of charged particles for the ATLAS trigger system. I was instrumental in the design and development of the Auxiliary card (AUX) firmware as well as hardware testing and validation from early prototype stages to the final production. The AUX card performs the first stage of track fitting using 8 of the 12 layers of the inner detector and is a key performance driver of the whole system.

* Firmware Design
  * Responsible for the design, implementation and validation of the Data Organizer, a firmware component allowing for high bandwidth associative storage and retrieval of hit coordinates for input to the first stage track fitters. 
  * Leader of FPGA resource usage and performance optimization. 
  * Developed customized firmware compilation scripts allowing for more consistent results and collaborative firmware versioning. 
* Commissioning and Validation
  * Developed a suite of resting tools for bit level emulation and functional simulation of various firmware components.
  * A primary developer of AUX online monitoring software enabling rapid problem diagnosis and replication in simulation environments.
  * Developed the board checkout and validation procedure for production and led several undegraduate and graduate students to qualify boards.
* Integration with ATLAS
  * Lead AUX installation and integration with ATLAS. 
  * Advised two graduate students on firmware design, testing and integration at CERN.
