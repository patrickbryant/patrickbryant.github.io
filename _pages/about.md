I am a postdoc at Carnegie Mellon University working to understand if the dynamics governing the particles and forces we enjoy today are stable or metastable.
Everything from the structure of the periodic table to extended objects able to support themselves against the pull of gravity rely on the current vacuum value of the Higgs field.

To the best of our experimental and theoretical precision, physics rests just over the edge of absolute stability.
Perhaps a few small errors or missing degrees of freedom are to blame.
It is also possible our current physics was acquired dynamically in the early universe via unknown mechanisms and that these dynamics will resume in the far future.
Our best hope of addressing this question experimentally is to precisely pin down the masses of the two heaviest known particles, the Higgs boson and top quark and to verify that the Higgs field self interaction has the expected form.
